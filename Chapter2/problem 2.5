problem 2.5
Identify the problem: Need to sum 2 numbers inside of a linked list
Define Goals: Work on small instance of the problem. Write down how to solve the small instance. Generalize small instance to solve the bigger problem

step 1: 
Input: (7-> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2).That is,617 + 295.
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9. That is, 912.
so
Input: (0-> 0 -> 1) + (0-> 0-> 6). That is 100 + 600
Output: (0-> 0-> 7)
How do you work this out?
step 2: Write down wat you did
First, we add 7 and 5 to get 12. The digit 2 becomes the last digit of the number, and 1 gets carried over to
the next step. Second, we add 1, 1, and 9 to get 11. The 1 becomes the second digit, and the other 1 gets
carried over the final step. Third and finally, we add 1, 6 and 2 to get 9. So, our value becomes 912.

I looked at each element in the linkedlist and remembered it. Then I looked at all elements from the second list and remembered it. Then I added both stored numbers.
Step 3: Find patterns: Storing memory and accessing it > arrays
for each element in the list, store such element in an array 
step 5: Translate to Code
LinkedListNode addlists(LinkedListNode 11, LinkedListNode 12, int carry) {
if (11 ==Â·null && 12 == null && carry== 0) {
3 return null;
4 }

6 LinkedlistNode result new LinkedlistNode();
7 int value = carry;
8 if (11 != null) {
9 value += 11.data;
10 }
11 if (12 != null) {

12 value += 12.data;
13 }
14
15 result.data value% 10; /* Second digit of number */
16
17 /*Recurse */
18 if (11 != null II 12 != null) {
19 LinkedlistNode more = addlists(ll == null ? null : 11.next,
20 12 == null? null : 12 . next,
21 value>= 10? 1 : 0);
22 result.setNext(more);
23 }
24 return result;
25 }
